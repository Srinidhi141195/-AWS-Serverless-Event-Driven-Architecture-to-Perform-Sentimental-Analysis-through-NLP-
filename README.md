# -AWS-Serverless-Event-Driven-Architecture-to-Perform-Sentimental-Analysis-through-NLP-

n my latest project, I've developed an automated, Event-Driven Workflow using AWS services for processing emails, images, and PDFs. This system integrates S3, SNS, SQS, Lambda, Comprehend, Rekognition, and DynamoDB to automate tasks efficiently. It features sentiment analysis using AWS Comprehend and NLP techniques to predict emotional tones from text, identifying sentiments through keywords like 'persistence' or 'procrastination'.

This project employs an Event-Driven, fan-out architecture in AWS, showcasing AI's potential in enhancing various applications, from email handling to image processing. This approach not only simplifies complex NLP system design but also optimizes data stream processing by decoupling tasks.

Implementing this architecture in AWS creates serverless computing and AI analytics, ensuring scalability and efficient data processing. Each component, from email categorization to image analysis, functions independently within a unified system, allowing for modular development, testing, and deployment.

Using AWS services like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and Rekognition demonstrates the practicality of cloud-native solutions, capable of processing large data volumes in real-time. This integration marks a significant advancement in AI applications, offering innovative, efficient solutions across various domains.

Link to the project documentation and the troubleshooting guide will be provided soon.
